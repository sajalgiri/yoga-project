Then work into the hip joint by moving your bent leg slowly from side to side.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Step 2.</h2>\r\n<br>\r\n<p align:justify>Sit on the floor with both legs extended in seated staff posture. Bend the left knee as in the warm up position. To bring the leg into half lotus pose, hold the left foot in close to the navel and let the left knee move forward as it comes down toward the earth (there is a sense of rolling the ball of the thighbone in the hip socket while you square the hips to the front).</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Step 3.</h2>\r\n<br>\r\n<p align:justify>Bring the outer ankle to the very top of the right thigh.

If your shoulders are tight, turn your index fingers out slightly; otherwise arrange them parallel to each other. If you\'re uneasy about this pose, you\'re not alone. To ready yourself for and secure yourself in this inversion, firm your shoulder blades against your back torso and pull them toward your tailbone. Then rotate your upper arms outward, to keep the shoulder blades broad, and hug your outer arms inward. Finally spread your palms and press the bases of the index fingers firmly against the floor.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Step 2.</h2>\r\n<br>\r\n<p align:justify>Now bend one knee and step the foot in, closer to the wall (we\'ll say it\'s the left leg), but keep the other (i.e. right) leg active by extending through the heel. Then take a few practice hops before you try to launch yourself upside down. Sweep your right leg through a wide arc toward the wall and kick your left foot off the floor, immediately pushing through the heel to straighten the left knee. As both legs come off the ground, engage your deep core abdominal muscles to help lift your hips over your shoulders. Hop up and down like this several times, each time pushing off the floor a little higher. Exhale deeply each time you hop.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Step 3.</h2>\r\n<br>\r\n<p align:justify>Hopping up and down like this may be all you can manage for now. Regularly practice strengthening poses, like Adho Mukha Svanasana and Plank Pose. Eventually you\'ll be able to kick all the way into the pose. At first your heels may crash into the wall, but again with more practice you\'ll be able to swing your heels up lightly to the wall.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Step 4.</h2>\r\n<br>\r\n<p align:justify>If your armpits and groins are tight, your lower back may be deeply arched. To lengthen this area, draw your front ribs into your torso, reach your tailbone toward your heels, and slide your heels higher up the wall. Squeeze the outer legs together and roll the thighs in. Hang your head from a spot between your shoulder blades and gaze out into the center of the room.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Step 5.</h2>\r\n<br>\r\n<p align:justify>To start stay in the pose 10 to 15 seconds, breathing deeply. Gradually work your way up to 1 minute. When you come down, be sure not to sink onto the shoulders. Keep your shoulder blades lifted and broad, and take one foot down at a time, each time with an exhalation. Stand in Uttanasana for 30 seconds to 1 minute. We tend to kick up with the same leg all the time: be sure to alternate your kicking leg, one day right, next day left.</p><br>', '<h3>Benefits:-</h3>\r\n<p align:justify>Strengthening Your Upper Body.<br>\r\nRelieves Stress.<br>\r\nIncreases Focus.<br>\r\nImproves Blood Flow To The Eyes.<br>\r\nStrengthens Shoulders And Arms.<br>\r\nDevelops Strength In The Core Muscles.</p><br>\r\n', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/eFmjckKXEoA'),

Lace your fingers together and set the forearms on the floor, elbows at shoulder width. Roll the upper arms slightly outward, but press the inner wrists firmly into the floor. Set the crown of your head on the floor. If you are just beginning to practice this pose, press the bases of your palms together and snuggle the back of your head against the clasped hands. More experienced students can open their hands and place the back of the head into the open palms.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Step 2.</h2>\r\n<br>\r\n<p align:justify>Inhale and lift your knees off the floor. Carefully walk your feet closer to your elbows, heels elevated. Actively lift through the top thighs, forming an inverted \"V.\" Firm the shoulder blades against your back and lift them toward the tailbone so the front torso stays as long as possible. This should help prevent the weight of the shoulders collapsing onto your neck and head.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Step 3.</h2>\r\n<br>\r\n<p align:justify>Exhale and lift your feet away from the floor. Take both feet up at the same time, even if it means bending your knees and hopping lightly off the floor. As the legs (or thighs, if your knees are bent) rise to perpendicular to the floor, firm the tailbone against the back of the pelvis. Turn the upper thighs in slightly, and actively press the heels toward the ceiling (straightening the knees if you bent them to come up). The center of the arches should align over the center of the pelvis, which in turn should align over the crown of the head.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Step 4.</h2>\r\n<br>\r\n<p align:justify>Firm the outer arms inward, and soften the fingers. Continue to press the shoulder blades against the back, widen them, and draw them toward the tailbone. Keep the weight evenly balanced on the two forearms. It\'s also essential that your tailbone continues to lift upward toward the heels. Once the backs of the legs are fully lengthened through the heels, maintain that length and press up through the balls of the big toes so the inner legs are slightly longer than the outer.</p><br>\r\n\r\n<h2>Step 5.</h2>\r\n<br>\r\n<p align:justify>As a beginning practitioner stay for 10 seconds. Gradually add 5 to 10 seconds onto your stay every day or so until you can comfortably hold the pose for 3 minutes. Then continue for 3 minutes each day for a week or two, until you feel relatively comfortable in the pose. Again gradually add 5 to 10 seconds onto your stay every day or so until you can comfortably hold the pose for 5 minutes.

(7, 2, 'Legs-Up-the-Wall Pose', 'wallpose.jpeg', '<h2>Step 1.</h2>\r\n<br>\r\n<p align:justify>Before performing the pose, determine two things about your support: its height and its distance from the wall. If you\'re stiffer, the support should be lower and placed farther from the wall; if you\'re more flexible, use a higher support that is closer to the wall. Your distance from the wall also depends on your height: if you\'re shorter move closer to the wall, if taller move farther from the wall. Experiment with the position of your support until you find the placement that works for you.</p><br>\r\n\r\n<h2>Step 2.</h2>\r\n<br>\r\n<p align:justify>Start with your support about 5 to 6 inches away from the wall. Sit sideways on right end of the support, with your right side against the wall (left-handers can substitute \"left\" for \"right\" in these instructions). Exhale and, with one smooth movement, swing your legs up onto the wall and your shoulders and head lightly down onto the floor. The first few times you do this, you may ignominiously slide off the support and plop down with your buttocks on the floor. Don\'t get discouraged. Try lowering the support and/or moving it slightly further off the wall until you gain some facility with this movement, then move back closer to the wall.</p><br>\r\n\r\n<h2>Step 3.</h2>\r\n<br>\r\n<p align:justify>Your sitting bones don\'t need to be right against the wall, but they should be \"dripping\" down into the space between the support and the wall. Check that the front of your torso gently arches from the pubis to the top of the shoulders. If the front of your torso seems flat, then you\'ve probably slipped a bit off the support. Bend your knees, press your feet into the wall and lift your pelvis off the support a few inches, tuck the support a little higher up under your pelvis, then lower your pelvis onto the support again.</p><br>\r\n\r\n<h2>Step 4.</h2>\r\n<br>\r\n<p align:justify>Lift and release the base of your skull away from the back of your neck and soften your throat. Don\'t push your chin against your sternum; instead let your sternum lift toward the chin. Take a small roll (made from a towel for example) under your neck if the cervical spine feels flat. Open your shoulder blades away from the spine and release your hands and arms out to your sides, palms up.</p><br>\r\n\r\n<h2>Step 5.</h2>\r\n<br>\r\n<p align:justify>Keep your legs relatively firm, just enough to hold them vertically in place. Release the heads of the thigh bones and the weight of your belly deeply into your torso, toward the back of the pelvis. Soften your eyes and turn them down to look into your heart.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>Step 6.</h2>\r\n<br>\r\n<p align:justify>Stay in this pose anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes. Be sure not to twist off the support when coming out. Instead, slide off the support onto the floor before turning to the side. You can also bend your knees and push your feet against the wall to lift your pelvis off the support. Then slide the support to one side, lower your pelvis to the floor, and turn to the side. Stay on your side for a few breaths, and come up to sitting with an exhalation.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>', '<h3>Benefits:-</h3>\r\n<p align:justify>Relaxation.<br>\r\nFacilitates venous drainage and increases circulation.<br>\r\nSoothes swollen or cramped feet and legs.<br>\r\nStretches the hamstrings and lower back.<br>\r\nRelieves lower back tension.<br>\r\nPelvic Floor Relaxation.</p><br>', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/_OQEIiZLY-0'),
